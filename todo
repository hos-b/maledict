# maybe doing
* change displayed id from list index to transaction_id, but again in hex. pros/cons?
    pros:
        + less total code
        + could help with query mode
    cons:
        - more coding
        - potentially breaking what's working 

# nice to have but meh
* add inverse video text mode for selected indices in terminal
* add scroll bars

# not doing
* supporting all screen sizes
* supporting resizing
