* export to CSV
* query mode

# maybe doing
change index from list index to transaction_id, but again in hex. pros/cons?
pros:
+ less total code
+ could help with query mode
cons:
- more coding
- potentially breaking what's working 

# nice to have but meh
* add inverse video text mode for terminal
* add scroll bars
